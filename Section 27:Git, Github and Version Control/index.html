            <h2>1. Introduction to Version Control and Git</h2>
            <p><strong>Version control</strong> is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Git</strong> is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.</p>

        <section id="cli">
            <h2>2. Version Control using Git and the Command Line</h2>
            <p>Git is primarily used via the command line. Here are some of the most basic and essential commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git init</code>: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.</li>
                <li><code>git status</code>: Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.</li>
                <li><code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>: Adds a file to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit.</li>
                <li><code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code>: Records a snapshot of the staging area to the repository's history.</li>
                <li><code>git log</code>: Shows the commit history for the current repository.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="remotes">
            <h2>3. GitHub and Remote Repositories</h2>
            <p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</p>
            <p>A <strong>remote repository</strong> is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git remote add origin &lt;repository_url&gt;</code>: Connects your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.</li>
                <li><code>git push -u origin main</code>: Pushes your committed changes to the remote repository.</li>
                <li><code>git pull</code>: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local repository.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="gitignore">
            <h2>4. .gitignore</h2>
            <p>A <code>.gitignore</code> file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. This is typically used for files that are generated automatically, such as build artifacts, log files, or files containing sensitive information like API keys.</p>
            <p>Each line in a <code>.gitignore</code> file specifies a pattern. For example:</p>
            <pre>
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore .log files
*.log

# Ignore a specific file
config.local.js
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="cloning">
            <h2>5. Cloning</h2>
            <p><strong>Cloning</strong> is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. When you clone a repository, you get the entire history of the project, not just the current state of the files.</p>
            <p>To clone a repository, you use the <code>git clone</code> command followed by the URL of the repository:</p>
            <pre><code>git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="branching">
            <h2>6. Branching and Merging</h2>
            <p><strong>Branching</strong> in Git allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. This is especially useful for developing new features or fixing bugs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git branch &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Creates a new branch.</li>
                <li><code>git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Switches to the specified branch.</li>
                <li><code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Creates a new branch and switches to it in one command.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Merging</strong> is the process of integrating the changes from one branch into another. For example, once a new feature is complete, you would merge the feature branch back into the main branch.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>git merge &lt;branch_name&gt;</code>: Merges the specified branch's history into the current branch.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="forking">
            <h2>7. Forking and Pull Requests</h2>
            <p><strong>Forking</strong> is similar to cloning, but it's done on the server side (e.g., on GitHub). A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
            <p>A <strong>Pull Request (PR)</strong> is a way to propose your changes to the original repository. You create a pull request to let the original repository's owner know that you have changes you'd like them to consider. If they approve the pull request, your changes will be merged into the original repository.</p>
            <p>The general workflow is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fork the repository on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Clone your forked repository to your local machine.</li>
                <li>Create a new branch for your changes.</li>
                <li>Make your changes and commit them.</li>
                <li>Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.</li>
            </ol>
